## 4. Sum of Chars
Write a program that sums the ASCII codes of n characters. Print the sum on the console.

### Input
- On the first line, you will receive n – the number of lines that follow.
- On the next n lines – you will receive letters from the Latin alphabet.

### Output
Print the total sum in the following format:
"The sum equals: {totalSum}"

### Constraints
-	n will be in the interval [1…20].
-	The characters will always be either upper or lower-case letters from the English alphabet.
-	You will always receive one letter per line.

## 5.	Print Part of the ASCII Table
Find online more information about ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) and write a program that prints part of the ASCII table of characters at the console.  
On the first line of input, you will receive the char index you should start with, and on the second line - the index of the last character you should print.

### Examples

| Input  | Output |   
| ------ | ------ |
|60      | < = > ? @ A |
|65      |        |

| 79      |        |
| Input  | Output |  
| 97     |a b c d e f g h|
| 104      |        |
| Input  | Output |  
| 40     |( ) * + , - . / 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7|
